    <h1>HTML Favicon Code</h1>
    <p>A favicon is a small image file that contains one or more icons that can be used to represent a website, blog, or even a single web page. A favicon is a small image file that contains one or more icons that can be used to represent a website, blog, or even a single web page.</p>
    <p>Favicons typically appear in places such as the browser's tab, address bar, browser history, bookmarks bar, etc. Favicons are a great way to distinguish your site from others â€” especially when users have many tabs open or they're searching through their browser history or bookmarks bar. Favicons assist in the visibility of your brand, as users will learn to associate the favicon's colors, fonts, etc with your brand as they use your website. </p>
    <p>If you don't have a favicon for your website, users will usually just see a generic web page icon.</p>
    <p></p>
  <h1>Adding a Favicon to your Website</h1>
  <p>First you need to upload a favicon to your server. You can call it anything and place it anywhere, but, if you call it favicon.ico and place it in the website's root directory, most browsers will automatically display it. Having said that, you can also add some HTML code to your website to ensure that browsers know which favicon to use.</p>
  <p>Here's an example of the code you can use. Place it inside the head element (replace the image location with the location of the image to be used):</p>
    <p>Note that if you use this code, you can name the favicon anything you like.</p>
    <p>Also, although this example uses the .ico extension, you could use other image formats, such as .png. .gif, .jpeg, and even animated GIFs. However, the .ico format has had wide acceptance from browsers for quite some time and is a common format when using favicons.</p>
    <p>Favicons can be 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, or 64x64 pixels in size, and 8-bit, 24-bit, or 32-bit in color depth.</p>
